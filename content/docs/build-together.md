## Building open camp Together

One of the key principles of open camp is "**open**".

Apart from open sourcing any custom materials or projects that we have
developed, we intend to develop our curriculum or learning materials publicly
as well.

All our materials can be found on Github at [opencamp-cc](https://github.com/opencamp-cc).

If you would like to participate in this process, either as viewer or as an
active contributor, you can join us our discussions or our live discussions via
one of the following channels:

- Discord: [open camp server](https://discord.gg/JVQVhQmQzk)
- X (formerly Twitter): [@opencampcc](https://twitter.com/opencampcc)
- [Upcoming Schedule](/docs/schedule) page

We welcome anyone from beginners to programming to experience software engineers
and leaders to join us any of our Build Together calls.

## Guest Speakers

We are actively looking for guest speakers to share their experience working in
the tech industry with our students. Please reach out to victor@opencamp.cc
if you are keen to share.

## Using our materials

Materials developed by open camp is designed to be usable and accessible by all,
and we welcome other schools and bootcamps to use them.

If you would explore running your own open camp in your city or timezone, please
send an email to victor@opencamp.cc and we can discuss further.
