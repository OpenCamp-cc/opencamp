## Building open camp Together

One of the key principles of open camp is "**open**".

Apart from open sourcing any custom materials or projects that we have
developed, we intend to develop our curriculum or learning materials publicly
as well.

All our materials can be found on Github at [opencamp-cc](https://github.com/opencamp-cc).

If you would like to participate in this process, either as viewer or as an
active contributor, you can join us our discussions or our live discussions via
one of the following channels:

- Discord: [open camp server](https://discord.gg/JVQVhQmQzk)
- X (formerly Twitter): [@opencampcc](https://twitter.com/opencampcc)
- [Upcoming Schedule](/docs/schedule) page

We welcome anyone from beginners to programming to software developers and
leaders to join us any of our Build Together calls.
