### Reasons for starting open camp

Everyone deserves a chance to find a job and career that they love. However,
the cost of most coding bootcamps around the world have grown exhorbitantly
expensive as companies, especially venture backed ones, seek to grow their
revenues year on year.

open camp was started to change this - our focus is on lowering the barriers to
entry (affordability) while keeping the bar high (challenging). At the same time,
we want to keep open camp "open" by allowing anyone to peek into the development
process and how the course is run.

After spending almost 10 years in the tech industry as a Software Engineer and
Engineering Manager, I joined a coding bootcamp to better understand the
challenges faced by prospective students and graduates in securing their first
job in the tech industry.

Equipped with this knowledge, I have decided to start open camp to enable more folks
to join the tech industry without breaking the bank while learning all the key skills
they need to be successful.

Word of warning: open camp is not designed to be easy; it's designed to help
highly motivated folks to challenge themselves to grow and join the tech
industry for a chance at a career that they will enjoy for life.
