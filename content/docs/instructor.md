Profile:

- Employee and Engineer #1 at Carousell, a unicorn-startup based in Singapore

- Spent 2 years (2022 ~ 2023) at a Coding Bootcamp helping over hundreds of students achieve their career goal of becoming a Software Engineer


### Reasons for starting open camp

open camp was started to help Software Engineers level up - our focus is on
lowering the barriers to entry (affordability) while keeping the bar high
(challenging). At the same time, we want to keep open camp "open" by allowing
anyone to peek into the development process and how the course is run.

After spending almost 10 years in the tech industry as a Software Engineer and
Engineering Manager, I joined a coding bootcamp back in 2022 to better
understand the challenges faced by prospective students and graduates in
securing their first job in the tech industry.

Equipped with this knowledge, I have decided to start open camp to help more folks
to grow faster in the tech industry without breaking the bank while learning all the
key skills they need to be successful.

Word of warning: open camp is not designed to be easy; it's designed to help
highly motivated folks to challenge themselves to grow and join the tech
industry to accelerate their growth in a career that they will enjoy for life.
