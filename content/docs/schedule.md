## Upcoming Schedule


### Cohort #0

    - Start: 8th January, 2024
    - End: 12th July 2024
- Estimated Cohort Size: 30 ~ 40 students

[Apply for Cohort #0 here](/docs/applications).

## Sample Learning Schedule

**Part-time Bootcamp (6 months)**

- Monday: Review Learning Materials + Peer Discussion + Live Session 1 in the evening at 7pm (GMT+8, Mandatory)
- Wednesday: Review Learning Materials + Peer Discussion
- Thursday: Review Learning Materials + Live Session 2 + Live Session 2 in the morning at 9am (GMT+8, Optional, recorded)
- Friday: Algorithms and Data Structures + Weekly Review
- Due Sunday evening: Submit Weekly Assignments / Project Updates

**You must be able to dedicate at least 2-4 hours daily in order to complete
all of your daily tasks and assignments.** Additional time will be given during the
weekends for you to complete the weekly assignments and submit them by Sunday.

Outside of the live sessions, questions and answers will be answered by the
instructor(s) online via our online group chat for each cohort.

Notes:

- Some weeks may have a slightly different schedule. For example, we may host events such as hackathons to help you complete your projects, or we may invite external speakers to share their experience.
- You are expected to dedicate time to complete weekly assignments and participate in peer discussions. Failure to do so may result in you being asked to leave the cohort.
- **If you prefer a learning environment that is fully guided by instructors, you may wish to explore local bootcamps in your area instead.**
