## FAQ

**Students**

- What happens if I am not able to catch up with the course schedule?

    You will be given up to 2 chances to catch up on assignments or tasks that
    you are unable to complete on schedule. Failure to do so may result in you
    being asked to leave the course. We will refund you based on the amount
    you have paid via prorated refund calculations.

- What happens if I have a personal emergency?

    We understand that personal emergencies may happen that may affect your
    ability to complete the course. Depending on the duration on the personal
    emergency, you may be allowed to continue with the course, or we will
    assist with transferring you to the next cohort. You may also request for a
    pro-rated refund if you wish to drop out of the course entirely.

- When will the full curriculum be available?

    We estimate that the draft version of our curriculum will be made available
    around earlier February 2025, with the first complete version to
    be available by May 2025 once Cohort #0 is complete.

    If you are interested in taking a look at the curriculum before it is ready,
    or just curious on how it is built, join us for one of our [Build Together
    sessions](/docs/build-together).

- When will the next cohort begin?

    We have yet to decide on when the next cohort will begin. If you would like
    to be notified once it has been decided, please drop an email to
    applications@opencamp.cc and we will send updates on future cohort to you.

- What is the refund policy?

    - 14 days or more before the start of cohort: full refund [1]
    - 14 days or less before start of cohort: 90% refund [1]
    - First 7 days: 75% refund [2]
    - After the first 7 days: prorated refund by weeks [1] [2]

    [1] We use Stripe to process payments, and Stripe does not refund service
      charges when we issue a refund. We will refund you based on our refund
      policy, minus these fees.

    [2] Example of prorated refund:
    - You request for a refund on week 2
    - You have opted for a monthly payment and made your first payment prior to the start of the class
    - Your refund will cover week 3 and week 4, minus Stripe fees (see [i])

    If you have opted to pay for the entire course, your refunds will cover week 3, week 4, and the remaining weeks, minus Stripe fees.


**Companies or Sponsors**

- Are we able to sponsor students for open camp?

    Thank you for supporting open camp. Yes, there are two sponsorship methods available:

    - Tuition fee sponsorship: cover partial / full tuition fee for the student(s)
    - Hiring sponsorship: hire our graduates and you can “refund” the tuition fee (partial / full) to our graduates directly, eg. sign-on bonus.

**I have other questions!**

Please send in your questions to applications@opencamp.cc and we’ll be happy to help answer your questions.
