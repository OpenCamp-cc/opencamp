## FAQ

**Students**

- What happens if I am not able to catch up with the course schedule?
    
    You will be given up to 2 chances to catch up on assignments or tasks that
    you are unable to complete on schedule. Failure to do so may result in you
    being asked to leave the Bootcamp. We will refund you based on the amount
    you have paid via prorated refund calculations.
    
- What happens if I have a personal emergency?
    
    We understand that personal emergencies may happen that may affect your
    ability to complete the course. Depending on the duration on the personal
    emergency, you may be allowed to continue with the course, or we will
    assist with transferring you to the next cohort. You may also request for a
    pro-rated refund if you wish to drop out of the Bootcamp entirely.
    
- When will the full curriculum be available?
    
    We estimate that the draft version of our curriculum will be made available
    around the Christmas period (Dec 2023), with the first complete version to
    be available by July 2024 once Cohort #0 is complete.

    If you are interested in taking a look at the curriculum before it is ready,
    or just curious on how it is built, join us for one of our [Build Together
    sessions](/docs/build-together).
    
- Will open camp help with job placements?
    
    Not at the moment. Our goal is to ensure that you are industry-ready by
    teaching real-world skills and building up a series of portfolio projects
    to demonstrate your skills.
    
    We do hope to be able to do so in future as we build up relationships with
    companies, tech recruiters, or recruitment agencies. We will also need to
    acquire a formal recruitment license in order to provide job placement
    opportunities for our graduates.


- When will the next cohort begin?
    
    We have yet to decide on when the next cohort will begin. If you would like
    to be notified once it has been decided, please drop an email to
    applications@opencamp.cc and we will send updates on future cohort to you.


    

**Companies or Sponsors**

- Why should we hire from open camp graduates?
    
    Unlike other Bootcamps, all learning and training materials used by open camp are open source and available for audit. Apart from technical skills, our students are required to gain proficiency in soft skills through peer sharing and discussions that will allow them to work successfully in modern software development teams.
    
    If you are interested in discussing how open camp might be able to help your hiring needs, please reach out to Victor (victor@opencamp.cc) for a discussion.
    
- Are we able to sponsor students for open camp?
    
    Thank you for supporting open camp. Yes, there are two sponsorship methods available:
    
    - Tuition fee sponsorship: cover partial / full tuition fee for the student(s)
    - Hiring sponsorship: hire our graduates as interns or full-time employees and you can “refund” the tuition fee (partial / full) to our graduates directly, eg. sign-on bonus.

**I have other questions!**

Please send in your questions to applications@opencamp.cc and we’ll be happy to help answer your questions.
